Rock Paper and Scissors game to show new javascript, html and css knowledge

#### Process and Some Thoughts:
I Started with the html so I can get an idea of how the boxes will be arranged, then I worked in CSS changin the background of those boxes so I can get an idea of the size and how to rearrange them. Tried to make everything with em, rem, % but some px was added at the end for some aesthetic tweaks. The logic part was the easiest but got stuck with some dumb mistakes. Showed it to a friend of mine and he helped me to improve some code, specially in the css part.

Found some cool tricks in the process that I think will be useful in the future

A really funny project but I got frustrated sometimes.
